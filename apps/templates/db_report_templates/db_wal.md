| **{{ col }}** | {{ val }} | {%- if col == "collected_at" -%}Timestamp when the statistics were collected.{%- 
elif col == "checkpoints_timed" -%}Number of time-scheduled checkpoints triggered by checkpoint_timeout.{%- 
elif col == "checkpoints_req" -%}Number of WAL-driven checkpoints triggered when max_wal_size was reached.{%- 
elif col == "checkpoints_total" -%}Total number of checkpoints (timed + requested).{%- 
elif col == "checkpoints_req_ratio_pct" -%}Percentage of checkpoints triggered by WAL pressure.{%- 
elif col == "checkpoint_write_time" -%}Total time spent writing dirty buffers during checkpoints (ms).{%- 
elif col == "checkpoint_sync_time" -%}Total time spent syncing data during checkpoints (ms).{%- 
elif col == "avg_checkpoint_time_ms" -%}Average time spent per checkpoint, including write and sync phases (ms).{%- 
elif col == "buffers_checkpoint" -%}Number of buffers written during checkpoints.{%- 
elif col == "slru_written" -%}Number of SLRU (transaction status) buffers written by checkpoints.{%- 
elif col == "buffers_clean" -%}Buffers written by the background writer (cleaned proactively).{%- 
elif col == "maxwritten_clean" -%}Times the background writer stopped early because it hit its write limit.{%-

elif col == "stats_reset_bgwriter" -%}Timestamp when bgwriter statistics were last reset.{%- 
elif col == "buffers_backend" -%}Buffers written directly by backend processes (not by the background writer or checkpointer). High values indicate I/O pressure affecting client queries.{%- 
elif col == "buffers_backend_fsync" -%}Times backend processes had to perform their own fsync(). Should be zero; non-zero indicates storage or checkpointer bottlenecks.{%-
